# Crypto September Seasonality — GitHub Pages Site

This repository hosts a static site that tests the claim: **"September is historically the worst month for cryptocurrency."**

**Quick publish (GitHub Pages):**
1. Create a new GitHub repo (public).
2. Upload the contents of this folder to the root of the repo.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**, set **Source: Deploy from a branch**, **Branch: `main` (root)**.
4. Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## What's inside
- `index.html` — the article with embedded figures and links to CSVs.
- `assets/images/` — PNG figures.
- `data/` — CSV outputs (returns, tests, bootstrap results).
- `assets/css/style.css` — styling (no JS required).

## Local development
Just open `index.html` in a browser. No build step required.
